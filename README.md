# Identifying-at-risk-students-
This was a machine learning project to identify at-risk students in undergraduate courses at ASU. I was part of a Research team at Edplus, ASU during which I built end-to-end ML pipeline to achieve this goal. 

Please find our team's research paper at [link](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-78270-2_22)  

I have attached my project's presentation which explains the complete ML pipeline. I cannot attach data/code since it is ASU's property. Please reach out to me if you have any questions.
